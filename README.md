# Linear Regression House Price Prediction

This is a machine learning project aimed at helping a real estate agent predict house prices for regions in the USA. The project utilizes a Linear Regression model to estimate the price of houses based on various parameters.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains 7 columns and 5000 rows. It has been obtained from Kaggle.com and includes the following columns:

1. 'Avg. Area Income': Average income of the householder of the city where the house is located.
2. 'Avg. Area House Age': Average age of houses in the same city.
3. 'Avg. Area Number of Rooms': Average number of rooms in houses in the same city.
4. 'Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms': Average number of bedrooms in houses in the same city.
5. 'Area Population': Population of the city.
6. 'Price': Price at which the house was sold.
7. 'Address': Address of the houses.

## How to Use the Repository
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed, such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn.
3. The dataset 'house_price_dataset.csv' should be placed in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook or Python script.
4. Open the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to access the code.
5. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), split the data, build the Linear Regression model, evaluate its performance, and make predictions.
